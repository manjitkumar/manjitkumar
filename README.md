## About Me
I am a software Engineer with a decade of experience in building and scaling web applications for high-growth startups and enterprise teams. My expertise lies in using technologies like Python, Django, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, TypeScript, NodeJS, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, GHAs, Kubernetes and AWS. 

As an early backend engineer, I have contributed to the growth of a hyper-growth [startup](https://blinkit.com) by building various web applications from the ground up where the user base grew from zero to over 10 million users in just four years. My role also included building and managing cloud infrastructure, creating an in-house content management system, and developing REST APIs to serve consumer applications on various platforms. I have also worked on creating developer tools to help other product engineers effectively deploy, manage, and monitor their cloud infrastructure for mission-critical services.
