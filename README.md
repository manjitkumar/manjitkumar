### Hello World! 

Email: pymanreads [at] gmail [dot] com


I am a Sr. Software Engineer with a decade of experience in building and scaling web applications for high-growth startups and enterprise companies. My expertise lies in using technologies like Python, Django, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, TypeScript, NodeJS, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Nomad, Consul and AWS. As a backend engineer and platform engineer, I have contributed to the growth of a hyper-growth startup where the user base grew from zero to over 10 million users in just four years. My role included building and managing cloud infrastructure, creating in-house content management systems, and developing REST APIs to serve consumer applications on various platforms. I have also worked on creating developer tools to help other product engineers effectively deploy, manage and monitor their cloud infrastructure for mission-critical services. I am looking to bring my experience and expertise to a growing company and contribute to their growth journey while continuously learning and expanding my skill set.
