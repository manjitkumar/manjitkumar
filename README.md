### Hi there 👋

<!--
**manjitkumar/manjitkumar** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a Senior Software Engineer with a decade of experience in building and scaling web applications for high-growth startups and enterprise companies. My expertise lies in using technologies like Python, Django, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, Docker and AWS. As a backend engineer and platform engineer, I have contributed to the growth of a hyper-growth startup where the user base grew from zero to over 10 million users in just four years. My role included building and managing cloud infrastructure, creating in-house content management systems, and developing REST APIs to serve consumer applications on various platforms. I have also worked on creating developer tools to help other product engineers effectively deploy, manage and monitor their cloud infrastructure for mission-critical services. I am looking to bring my experience and expertise to a growing company and contribute to their growth journey while continuously learning and expanding my skill set.
